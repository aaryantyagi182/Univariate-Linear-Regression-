Linear Regression with NumPy and Python

We don't use any special libraby like sciket learn to perform this linear regression

It is very useful if you want to understand the logic behind the Linear Regression

The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function
 Compute the Cost  𝐽(𝜃)

𝐽(𝜃)=1/2𝑚∑(ℎ𝜃(𝑥'−𝑦')2
 
where  ℎ𝜃(𝑥)  is the hypothesis and given by the linear model

ℎ𝜃(𝑥)=𝜃𝑇=𝜃(0)+𝜃(1)𝑥(1)
